# Quick Start - Adding Your Images

## 📁 Create These Folders

In your `public` folder, create two new folders:

```
public/
├── projects/
└── certificates/
```

## 📸 Add Your Images

### 1. Your Profile Photo
- Add `profile.jpg` to the `public` folder
- Recommended: Square image, 512x512px or larger

### 2. Project Screenshots
Add these images to `public/projects/`:
- `eduquest.jpg` - Screenshot of your EduQuest project
- `ghrass.jpg` - Screenshot of Ghrass Library
- `ecommerce-api.jpg` - API documentation or Postman screenshot
- `products-management.jpg` - Screenshot of the management system

### 3. Your Certificates
Add these images to `public/certificates/`:
- `react-cert.jpg` - Your React certificate
- `backend-cert.jpg` - Your Back-End certificate
- `preprogramming-cert.jpg` - Your Pre-Programming certificate

## ⚡ Quick Commands

```bash
# Create the folders (Windows PowerShell)
New-Item -Path "public\projects" -ItemType Directory -Force
New-Item -Path "public\certificates" -ItemType Directory -Force

# Or manually create the folders in Windows Explorer
```

## 🎨 Image Tips

- **Format**: JPG, PNG, or WebP all work
- **Size**: Larger is better, but keep under 2MB per image
- **Names**: Must match exactly (case-sensitive)
- **Optional**: If you don't add an image, a gradient placeholder shows

## 🚀 That's It!

Once you add your images, refresh the page and they'll appear automatically!

**Don't have all images ready?** No problem! The site looks great with the gradient placeholders too. Add images whenever you're ready.
